## Introduction to Project

This repository was created to showcase my interest in the GreenFieldData project. Using an open dataset from Kaggle, I implemented machine learning approaches to help optimize tasks commonly found in agriculture.

## Climate Change Impact on Agriculture 

This notebook implements exploratory analysis.

The original dataset source is:   [Original Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture)

The most up-to-date notebook versions are on Kaggle : [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cesaranasco1995/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture-exanaly)



## Grapevine Disease 

This notebook implements exploratory analysis, data augmentation, and transfer learning for disease detection using an EfficientNetV2-S model.

The original dataset source is:   [Original Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pushpalama/grape-disease)

The most up-to-date notebook versions are on Kaggle : [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cesaranasco1995/grapevine-disease-dataset-exploratory-analysis/notebook)

### Remarks

The number of epochs is currently set to 2, and training takes about 2 hours to run. During testing accuracy arrived to 99%.

### How to use

This project uses Kaggle directories. If you run it outside Kaggle, you will need to update the paths to match your local directory structure.
