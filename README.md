## Introduction to Machine Learning Group Project

This notebook implements exploratory analysis, data augmentation, and transfer learning using an EfficientNetV2-S model.

The original dataset source is:   [Original Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pushpalama/grape-disease)

The most up-to-date notebook versions are on Kaggle : [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cesaranasco1995/grapevine-disease-dataset-exploratory-analysis/notebook)

## Remarks

The number of epochs is currently set to 2, and training takes about 1.5 hours to run. The main improvement area is the training stage—running more epochs (and tuning hyperparameters) should improve performance.

## How to use

This project uses Kaggle directories. If you run it outside Kaggle, you will need to update the paths to match your local directory structure.
